<h1>Homework 7: My Own Chorpleth! </h1>
<h2>Chase Brooks</h2>
<h3>This is a map of the countries of the world by their number of Holocene volcanoes (volcanoes active since approx. 12,000 years ago).
    The data I used come from the Smithsonian Institution's Global Volcanism Project, although I created the CSV file used myself.
    The world administrative boundaries shapefile I used came from opendatasoft.com and was publicly available information.
    I chose this data because I think volcanoes are pretty cool.
